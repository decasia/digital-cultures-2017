# Scrapbook Assignments

As we've discussed in class, your own research work in class will revolve around building a digital scrapbook.

Prerequisite: As discussed in Week 2, you'll build your scrapbook on [Medium](http://www.medium.com/), so you need to make a Medium account and follow mine ([@decasia](https://medium.com/@decasia)), if you haven't already.

## Entry 1. Media Ideologies in your culture

**Due Tues., Feb 7 (before class starts)**

Your first Medium post should have two parts:

1. Start with a general introduction to your project. It is fine to paste in your already-written project description from the shared Google Doc! Please also add a few illustrations of interesting things about your chosen site, such as pictures, quotations, or web links.

2. Find an example of a *miscommunication* from your chosen culture. Then break it down by answering the following questions:

  1. What was said?
  2. What medium was it said in?
  3. What did the sender think they were saying?
  4. What did the recipient think the sender was saying?
  5. What were the sender's ideologies and expectations about this medium (as far as you can tell)?
  6. What were the recipient's ideologies and expectations about the medium (as far as you can tell)?

The premise here is that when people miscommunicate, that's usually the result of incompatible assumptions and expectations. If you have any trouble answering parts (5) or (6), just start by writing down your own explanation of why the miscommunication happened, and we can talk more about your example in class.

## Entry 2: tl;dr

Post your first paper (or excerpts from it) prefixed with a [td;dr](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633) (in sense 2 of the definition, "a short summary of a long text that follows").

## Entry 3: Tech labor

**Due Thurs., March 23 (before class starts)**

All digital cultures require technological work to keep them running. This means that there is normally someone whose job is to do the technical maintenance and development. Write a short post, 1-2 paragraphs, describing what you can find out about the technical workers who maintain your chosen digital culture. If you are looking at a company-run website, for instance, try to find the job postings for the company and see what "kinds of people" are getting hired. Can you tell anything about their desired educational background, for example? Or about their skills? If certain kinds of technologies are mentioned, and you don't know what they are, try to look them up; try to avoid referring to technologies that you don't recognize.

## Entry 4: Weirdness

**Due Thurs., March 30 (before class starts)**

For the next few weeks we'll be talking about some of the unusual corners of the internet: PostSecret, the Hacker Manifesto, Silk Road, etc. For this week’s scrapbook, please find three examples of weird things in your digital culture, and write a paragraph explaining why they are weird. Weirdness, anthropologically speaking, is usually a matter of something being not only not normative, but also difficult to classify. To be weird is to resist interpretation (at least a little bit). You might keep that in mind as you try to sort out weird objects from garden variety transgressions, breaches of etiquette, irrelevancies, etc.

## Entry 5: Digital Economies

**Due Thurs., April 20 (before class starts)**

 For your last scrapbook entry, write a paragraph describing the economy at work in your digital culture. Here are some questions to consider:
- Who pays for the infrastructure? How much does it cost? Is it profitable? (Note that many major social media firms are not very profitable, in spite of their large user bases!)
- Who does the work of producing content? Is their work compensated (financially or otherwise)? Are there gender, racial, or other sociological divides in how people are compensated?
- Who does emotional labor in your digital culture? (This would include: calming down angry users; handling disputes; producing positive feeling; listening to complaints; etc.)
Refer to at least three sources (images, links, etc) in your description. This is due before class on Tuesday, April 26.

## Entry 6: Second tl;dr

**Due Thursday, April 27**

Post your second paper (or excerpts from it) prefixed with a [td;dr](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633) (in sense 2 of the definition, "a short summary of a long text that follows").

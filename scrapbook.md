# Scrapbook Assignments

As we've discussed in class, your own research work in class will revolve around building a digital scrapbook.

Prerequisite: As discussed in Week 2, you'll build your scrapbook on [Medium](http://www.medium.com/), so you need to make a Medium account and follow mine ([@decasia](https://medium.com/@decasia)), if you haven't already.

## Entry 1. Media Ideologies in your culture

**Due Tues., Feb 7 (before class starts)**

Your first Medium post should have two parts:

1. Start with a general introduction to your project. It is fine to paste in your already-written project description from the shared Google Doc! Please also add a few illustrations of interesting things about your chosen site, such as pictures, quotations, or web links.

2. Find an example of a *miscommunication* from your chosen culture. Then break it down by answering the following questions:

  1. What was said?
  2. What medium was it said in?
  3. What did the sender think they were saying?
  4. What did the recipient think the sender was saying?
  5. What were the sender's ideologies and expectations about this medium (as far as you can tell)?
  6. What were the recipient's ideologies and expectations about the medium (as far as you can tell)?

The premise here is that when people miscommunicate, that's usually the result of incompatible assumptions and expectations. If you have any trouble answering parts (5) or (6), just start by writing down your own explanation of why the miscommunication happened, and we can talk more about your example in class.

3. Post your first paper (or excerpts from it) prefixed with a [td;dr](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633) (in sense 2 of the definition, "a short summary of a long text that follows").

4. All digital cultures require technological work to keep them running. This means that there is normally someone whose job is to do the technical maintenance and development. Write a short post, 1-2 paragraphs, describing what you can find out about the technical workers who maintain your chosen digital culture. If you are looking at a company-run website, for instance, try to find the job postings for the company and see what "kinds of people" are getting hired. Can you tell anything about their desired educational background, for example? Or about their skills? If certain kinds of technologies are mentioned, and you don't know what they are, try to look them up; try to avoid referring to technologies that you don't recognize.

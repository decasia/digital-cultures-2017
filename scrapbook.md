# Scrapbook Assignments

As we've discussed in class, your own research work in class will revolve around building a digital scrapbook.

Prerequisite: As discussed in Week 2, you'll build your scrapbook on [Medium](http://www.medium.com/), so you need to make a Medium account and follow mine ([@decasia](https://medium.com/@decasia)), if you haven't already.

## Entry 1. Media Ideologies in your culture

**Due Tues., Feb 7 (before class starts)**

Your first Medium post should have two parts:

1. Start with a general introduction to your project. It is fine to paste in your already-written project description from the shared Google Doc! Please also add a few illustrations of interesting things about your chosen site, such as pictures, quotations, or web links.

2. Find an example of a *miscommunication* from your chosen culture. Then break it down by answering the following questions:

  1. What was said?
  2. What medium was it said in?
  3. What did the sender think they were saying?
  4. What did the recipient think the sender was saying?
  5. What were the sender's ideologies and expectations about this medium (as far as you can tell)?
  6. What were the recipient's ideologies and expectations about the medium (as far as you can tell)?

The premise here is that when people miscommunicate, that's usually the result of incompatible assumptions and expectations. If you have any trouble answering parts (5) or (6), just start by writing down your own explanation of why the miscommunication happened, and we can talk more about your example in class.

## Entry 2: tl;dr

Post your first paper (or excerpts from it) prefixed with a [td;dr](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633) (in sense 2 of the definition, "a short summary of a long text that follows").

## Entry 3: Tech labor

**Due Thurs., March 23 (before class starts)**

All digital cultures require technological work to keep them running. This means that there is normally someone whose job is to do the technical maintenance and development. Write a short post, 1-2 paragraphs, describing what you can find out about the technical workers who maintain your chosen digital culture. If you are looking at a company-run website, for instance, try to find the job postings for the company and see what "kinds of people" are getting hired. Can you tell anything about their desired educational background, for example? Or about their skills? If certain kinds of technologies are mentioned, and you don't know what they are, try to look them up; try to avoid referring to technologies that you don't recognize.

## Entry 4: Weirdness

**Due Thurs., March 30 (before class starts)**

For the next few weeks we'll be talking about some of the unusual corners of the internet: PostSecret, the Hacker Manifesto, Silk Road, etc. For this week’s scrapbook, please find three examples of weird things in your digital culture, and write a paragraph explaining why they are weird. Weirdness, anthropologically speaking, is usually a matter of something being not only not normative, but also difficult to classify. To be weird is to resist interpretation (at least a little bit). You might keep that in mind as you try to sort out weird objects from garden variety transgressions, breaches of etiquette, irrelevancies, etc.

## Entry 5: Digital Economies

**Due Thurs., April 20 (before class starts)**

 For your last scrapbook entry, write a paragraph describing the economy at work in your digital culture. Here are some questions to consider:
- Who pays for the infrastructure? How much does it cost? Is it profitable? (Note that many major social media firms are not very profitable, in spite of their large user bases!)
- Who does the work of producing content? Is their work compensated (financially or otherwise)? Are there gender, racial, or other sociological divides in how people are compensated?
- Who does emotional labor in your digital culture? (This would include: calming down angry users; handling disputes; producing positive feeling; listening to complaints; etc.)
Refer to at least three sources (images, links, etc) in your description. This is due before class on Tuesday, April 26.

## Entry 6: Second tl;dr

**Due Thursday, April 27**

Post your second paper (or excerpts from it) prefixed with a [td;dr](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tldr-2483633) (in sense 2 of the definition, "a short summary of a long text that follows").

## Final assignment

For our course’s final project, your assignment will be to write an introduction and conclusion to your scrapbook, and to put your scrapbook into a neat, coherent and presentable form. If you’ve been doing the scrapbook assignments all along, this should not be difficult! It could be divided into three steps:

1.	Clean up and improve your previous scrapbook assignments.
	-	If you missed any of the assignments, now is the time to go back and take care of them.
	-	Re-read each week’s post and make sure it is well explained and well written. Be sure you have addressed the whole assignment for that week. Make things look as neat as possible in terms of the formatting.
2.	Go back and expand your initial post introducing your scrapbook. Your introduction should do three things:
	-	Summarize in broad strokes the digital culture you are writing about. (You should already have lots of material that does this.)
	-	Explain how you got interested in your scrapbook topic and what is interesting (or not) about it. (So if you are writing about something you participate in directly — like gaming, fashion, blogging, etc — then explain how you got involved in those activities. If you are writing about something you don’t participate in directly, explain how you came across the topic. If you have become bored by your topic, explain how that happened.)
	-	Finally, write a brief preview of what is in your scrapbook, telling us about at least 3-4 of the best pieces of content you came across and telling the reader what to expect.
3.	Add a final concluding post 4-5 paragraphs long. Your goal here should be to draw some brief but general conclusions about what makes your digital culture tick.
	-	Pick three examples from your scrapbook that you think are particularly rich or striking. (They could be especially weird, especially wonderful, especially problematic, etc.)
	-	Explain something unexpected that you learned from each example.
	-	Write a brief final paragraph in which you summarize the unexpected things you learned. Explain if there is any underlying pattern that connects them. Referring to analytical concepts discussed in the course (like status, media ideologies, naturalization) would certainly be encouraged, if it is relevant.
4.	Finally, submit your scrapbook on Moodle by pasting the URL to your Medium profile into the Moodle assignment. That will tell me that you consider your project done.
